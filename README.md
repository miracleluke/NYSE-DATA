# NYSE-DATA
*In this project, I anaylzed real life data from the **New York Stock Exchange Dataset**.*
*This dataset is a subset of a large dataset provided by kaggle which contains historical financial data from S&P 500 companies.
*This dataset contains 1712 rows and 14 columns and financial data ranging from 2012 to 2016. this Financial data includes Total Revenue, Cost of Goods sold, Research and Development e.t.c for various GICS Sector including Industrials, Health Care, Information technology, utilities, Financials e.t.c and their GICS Sub Industry.
*I created a spreadsheet and presentation slide showing summary statistics (measures of spread and measures of center) of the Pharmaceuticals and Biotecnology sub industry of the Health Care sector.
*I also created a dashboard for a Profit and Loss Statement that calculates the Gross Profit, Operating Profit for all the years available for a company. I pulled the  historical data using **VLOOKUP** and **OFFSET** function. 
*Lastly, I created a financial model for a company that forecasts Gross Profit, Operating Profit for two more years using three scenarios (weak case, base case, and strong case). I calculated assumptions for Revenue Growth, Gross Margin and Operating margin.
